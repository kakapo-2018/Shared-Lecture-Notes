Bowling lecture. When everything is together. 

If double strike 
If triple strike 

How to start - getting lost in the theory rather than the actual theory. No real right answer - Bunch of bad ways to do stuff. We have a bunch of ways. Ugly code that works trumps clean code that doesn't.

Complex problem - simplifying problem. Our job is to make simple things easy and complex problems possible. 

One is 
How to make your code easier to work with and the other is test driven development. 

Today there are two exercises. We can stay on bowling for most of today if you want to,

Boiler plate is what we pick u.

Groking - how quickly can you look at something as understanding. Maps, filters and finds but are slow to understand. 

Don't prefactor code first. 

You can but 

Ctrl D - select the copy of it in the code

Complexity of the code -it tells what it is out. 

Solving the problem - first point - how will I know that I am right. 

TDD in general.  

Ping pong testing - our jobs is to mess with the test suite - function filter odds 

Module.export

Write the test. Score different frames.
