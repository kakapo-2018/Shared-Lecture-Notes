DATA STRUCTURES | TESTING WITH JEST | HANDBOOK 

Package JSON. Expand into data structures. Primitive data types and complex data types. Strings - they are primitive data types. A string is a collection of characters, Primitive data types are the primary building blocks. Char unit. We want to understand how things are broken down. Decimal places for a float. Floating point arithmetic. Reshaping our thinking in different ways.  We use them to model the real world. It exists in the real world. 

JSON.package Java Script Object Notation. API's Live and breath JSON - links most systems. Application Programming Interface. When engage with a graphical user interface - optic nerve - see things and engage with them that way. Don't need to communicate visually. Usually text based. Low level where performance matters. 

"double quotes" - are the currency of JSON. No comma's at the end. 

Code smells - data is difficult to engage with. Single responsibility. Get a function to just one thing. Code is written once and needs to be understood - help the next person. Not going to thank you past self. Pulling things out into the function. 

Being clever and tricky - code that explains itself - how well does it respond to change - how easily can it be changed. How user friendly is the code? 

Testing.  Touch test.js - Jest. 

Takes a higher order function as an argument. 

Testing Arrange What data does it need

Simple test - how many address lines have we got. 


 - Act - Assert

Assert is check this is true. 

Might you write the code performance based on the test? 


Arrange  what do you expect 

Act let actual be = function 

Arrange Act Assert
